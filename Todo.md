Activity for Today:
1. Testing MLO image on BBB   and Testing U-boot image on BBB. Explain each and every section of stage in the learning report.
2. SPend some time in uboot area and execute the commands. and also check for various environmental variables
2. Learn and quote the linux boot sequence after the booting.
