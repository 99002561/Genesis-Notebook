* Study of Core C++ (22nd)
* Study of Advanced C++(23rd)
    - Part1
    - Part2
    - Coding Tasks

    * get_id from std::thread
    * Detachable Threads
    * std::launch::async vs  std::launch::deferred
    * linked list examples
    * Mutual exclusion
    * Synchronization
    * ranged for loop
    * Launch async
    * exception handling
    * revise all concepts
    * what is async threads use
    * explicit for no assignment
    * All threads and ipc concepts
* Threads Assignment
* Lambda Implementation for Threads

## Oct 22
* Unique Lock and unique guard/Lock Guard(10a,10b)
* Dead Lock - pb2
* Self Study:
    1. Tuple
    2. Regular Expression
    3. Bind
    4. lambda
    5. Placeholder

Activity:-
* Post read of covered topics (thread, mutex, locks etc)
* Pre-read of next topic
* Coding Tasks
* File Handling, Namespaces (if pending)
* Exception Handling, give a try


## Oct 21
Activities:-
* post read of covered topics + practice examples
    - Smart Pointers
    - Universal Pointers
* continue coding tasks
* refresh thread & ipc concepts (linux os, posix apis)
	* threads
	* mutex
	* semaphore
	* producer consumer problem
	* deadlocks
Further:-
* concurrency in C++ ==> std::thread, std::async
* IPC techniques  ==> std::mutex, some locks, std::condition_variable etc.
* std::future, std::promise (if time permits)


## Oct 20
1. refresh move semantics, lambdas (covered topics)
    * check for the trivial and non trivial classes
    * Check copy constructor for trivial and non trivial classes
    * Algorithms and Lambda(https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm)
    * Apply all this concepts  
2. explore STL algorithms, apply in coding tasks with lambdas
3. self study (try) -- file handling -- ofstream, ifstream
4. pre-read
    std::bind
    some topics on templates
    smart pointers
5. vs setup for code style,visualization and analysis
