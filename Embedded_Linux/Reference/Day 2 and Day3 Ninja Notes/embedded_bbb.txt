Day3-------------------


 * Dtb files are called as device tree ( Flatterned Device tree )
 * The on board peripherals which connect to SPI, I2C, SDIO, Ethernet etc. Have no capability to announce there existence on the board by themselves to the operating system. These peripherals are also call as “Platform Devices” But USB device has the inbuilt intelligence to do the same.
 * Instead of adding hard coded hardware details in to the linux kernel board file, every board vendors has to come up with a file called DTS (Device Tree Source file).
 * This DTS file will be converted to DTB file using Device tree compiler.
